### Note
There's no commit history for this repo because most of the work was done in another one of my repos called "Flask TensorFlow image classifier," I copied it over and accidently didn't take the history with me, but this is the final working version.
The actual code for the model I created and used is also present in this separate repo under the modelTraining directory.
Here is the link for that repo: https://github.com/BenMueller1/Flask-TensorFlow-image-classifier, sorry about that
